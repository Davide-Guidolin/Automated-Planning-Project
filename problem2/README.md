# Problem 2

For this problem we developed two solutions, one that uses fluents and one that doesn't.
To run the solution that uses fluents we used [this](http://editor.planning.domains/) online planner.

To run the solution that does not use fluents execute the following command inside a planutils environment:
```shell
lama-first domain.pddl problem.pddl
```
