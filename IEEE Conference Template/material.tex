The code can be found in this github repository:

\url{
    https://github.com/Davide-Guidolin/Automated-Planning-Project
    }

The repository contains a folder for each problem. In each folder
you will find the domain and problem files and an \verb+out+ folder
that contains the screenshots of the plans, the screenshots of
the outputs of the planners and the content of these screenshots 
reported in text files. For problem 2 you will find two problem 
files and two domain files, along with two out folders, one for the
solution that does not use fluents and one for the solution
that uses it. For problem 5 you will find two problem 
folders \verb+problem5popf+ and \verb+problem5tfd+ containing 
the necessary files to run the problems on PlanSys2 using POPF and TFD planners.
You will find also two output folders, \verb+out_popf+ for the POPF
planner and \verb+out_tfd+ for the TFD planner.
In each problem folder you will find a README with the instructions
to run the planner. In the problem 5 README there are also the instructions
to setup the Docker and setup and run PlanSys2 with TFD or POPF.
