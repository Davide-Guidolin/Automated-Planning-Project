The first problem was solved simply by implementing what is described in the introduction above.
We set the environment with 1 robot, 3 people, 5 locations (one of which is the depot where the supplies are stored), 2 boxes and 3 types of supply.
Initially the 3 people are scattered over the locations, while robot, boxes and supplies are in the depot.
The goal is to deliver medicine to person2, and to deliver food and medicine to person3; person1 does not need anything.
